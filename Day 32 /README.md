# Jenkins Shared Libraries – Reusable Automation for Scalable Pipelines
Hello there, Jenkins adventurers! 🌟  
Today, we’re exploring  **Shared Libraries**  in Jenkins—a powerful feature that can transform how you build and manage pipelines in large-scale environments. If you're working in a team or handling multiple projects, Shared Libraries help centralize reusable code, making your pipelines more efficient and consistent.

A  **Shared Library**  in Jenkins is a way to store and share reusable Groovy scripts, pipeline functions, and configurations. Think of it as a “toolbox” of pre-written code that your pipelines can use, saving you from writing the same logic repeatedly.

1.  **Code Reusability**
    
    -   Write once, use everywhere. Define common pipeline steps, like test execution or deployment, and share them across all projects.
2.  **Consistency**
    
    -   Standardize your CI/CD processes across teams and projects.
3.  **Improved Collaboration**
    
    -   Teams can contribute to the library, improving and evolving it over time.
4.  **Ease of Maintenance**
    
    -   Fix or update pipeline logic in one place, and the changes reflect in all pipelines that use it.

1.  **Structure**
    
    -   Shared Libraries are organized in a specific folder structure within a Git repository:
        
        -   `vars/`: For defining reusable pipeline functions.
            
        -   `src/`: For storing Groovy classes.
            
        -   `resources/`: For static files like configuration templates.
            
2.  **Declarative or Scripted Pipelines**
    
    -   Shared Libraries can be used in both types of pipelines, offering flexibility for different teams.
3.  **Global vs. Folder-Specific Libraries**
    
    -   **Global Libraries**: Available to all Jenkins pipelines.
        
    -   **Folder Libraries**: Restricted to pipelines within a specific folder.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-33-of-100-days-jenkins-shared-libraries-reusable-automation-for-scalable-pipelines#heading-step-1-create-a-repository-for-the-library "Permalink")**Step 1: Create a Repository for the Library**

-   Structure the repo with  `vars/`,  `src/`, and  `resources/`.
    
-   Example:
    
    ```
      vars/  
        deployApp.groovy  
      src/  
        com/mycompany/utils/Helper.groovy
    
    ```

-   Create reusable functions in  `.groovy`  files under the  `vars/`  directory.
    
-   Example:
    
    ```
      def call(String environment) {  
          echo "Deploying application to ${environment}"  
      }
    
    ```

-   Go to  **Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Global Pipeline Libraries**.
    
-   Add your library details (Git URL, credentials, and branch).

-   Reference the library in your pipeline using the  `@Library`  annotation.
    
-   Example:
    
    ```
      @Library('my-shared-library') _  
      deployApp('production')
    
    ```

1.  **Version Control**
    
    -   Tag or version your library to ensure stability across pipelines.
2.  **Documentation**
    
    -   Provide clear documentation for each function to help your team understand and use it effectively.
3.  **Testing**
    
    -   Test your library functions independently before using them in pipelines.
4.  **Access Control**
    
    -   Restrict who can modify the library to maintain code quality.
