# Exploring Essential Linux Commands üêß


Welcome to Day 5! Today, we‚Äôre diving into core Linux commands that every DevOps professional should know. By the end of this post, you‚Äôll have practiced file management, system navigation, and even some basic troubleshooting.

Ready? Let's get started! üí™

----------

### Part 1: File & Directory Management üìÅ

1.  **Where am I?**  
    Use `pwd` to **print your current working directory**. This helps you know where you are in the Linux filesystem:
    
    ```plaintext
    pwd
    ```
    
2.  **See it All!**  
    List everything (including hidden files) with `ls -a`. Hidden files can contain configurations or settings:
    
    ```plaintext
    ls -a
    ```
    
3.  **Create Nested Directories**  
    Need to set up a folder structure? Create `A/B/C/D/E` in one go with the `-p` flag. Try it out:
    
    ```plaintext
    mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E
    ```
    
4.  **Change Directories**  
    Move to a directory using `cd`. Let‚Äôs navigate to `A/B/C`:
    
    ```plaintext
    cd A/B/C
    ```
    
5.  **Make and Break a Directory**  
    First, create a folder called `TestDir`:
    
    ```plaintext
    mkdir TestDir
    ```
    
    Then remove it using `rmdir` (only works if empty):
    
    ```plaintext
    rmdir TestDir
    ```
    
6.  **Create a File**  
    Use `touch` to make an empty file named `example.txt`. This is handy for setting up new files or updating timestamps:
    
    ```plaintext
    touch example.txt
    ```
    
7.  **Copy and Move Files**  
    Copy `example.txt` to a new file named `example_copy.txt`:
    
    ```plaintext
    cp example.txt example_copy.txt
    ```
    
    Then rename it using `mv`:
    
    ```plaintext
    mv example_copy.txt example_moved.txt
    ```
    
    Finally, delete it:
    
    ```plaintext
    rm example_moved.txt
    ```
    

----------

### Part 2: File Viewing & Editing üìÑ

1.  **View File Content**  
    Use `cat` to display everything in `example.txt`:
    
    ```plaintext
    cat example.txt
    ```
    
2.  **Need to Scroll?**  
    For larger files, `less` lets you scroll through content one page at a time:
    
    ```plaintext
    less example.txt
    ```
    
3.  **Get a Sneak Peek**  
    Use `head` to show the first 10 lines or `tail` for the last 10:
    
    ```plaintext
    head example.txt
    tail example.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Editing Time!**  
    Open `example.txt` with `nano` or `vim`, two popular text editors. You‚Äôll get familiar with both over time:
    
    ```plaintext
    nano example.txt
    vim example.txt
    ```
    

----------

### Part 3: Permissions & Ownership üîê

1.  **Adjust Permissions**  
    Want to set permissions? `chmod 744` gives the owner read, write, and execute permissions, and read-only for others:
    
    ```plaintext
    chmod 744 example.txt
    ```
    
2.  **Change Owner**  
    Use `chown` to assign a new owner and group:
    
    ```plaintext
    chown user:group example.txt
    ```
    
3.  **Detailed Listing**  
    Check out file permissions and ownership with `ls -l`:
    
    ```plaintext
    ls -l
    ```
    

----------

### Part 4: System Monitoring & Management üìä

1.  **What‚Äôs Running?**  
    The `top` command shows live processes, sorted by usage. Use `q` to quit:
    
    ```plaintext
    top
    ```
    
2.  **Detailed Process List**  
    `ps aux` provides more detailed info about all running processes:
    
    ```plaintext
    ps aux
    ```
    
3.  **Disk and Directory Usage**  
    Check available disk space with `df -h`:
    
    ```plaintext
    df -h
    ```
    
    And use `du -sh .` to see the size of your current directory:
    
    ```plaintext
    du -sh .
    ```
    
4.  **Memory and Uptime**  
    `free -h` shows memory usage in a human-readable format:
    
    ```plaintext
    free -h
    ```
    
    `uptime` lets you know how long the system has been running:
    
    ```plaintext
    uptime
    ```

### Additional Handy Commands üõ†Ô∏è

Here are a few more must-know commands to boost your productivity:

1.  **Command Shortcuts**  
    Make shortcuts with `alias`. For example, turn `ls -la` into a quick `ll`:
    
    ```plaintext
    alias ll='ls -la'
    ```
    
2.  **Search Within Files**  
    Look for specific text inside files using `grep`:
    
    ```plaintext
    grep "search_term" example.txt
    ```
    
3.  **Find Files**  
    Locate files by name with `find`:
    
    ```plaintext
    find /path/to/search -name "filename"
    ```
    
4.  **Archive Files**  
    Compress a directory with `tar`. This example creates a `.tar.gz` archive:
    
    ```plaintext
    tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory
    ```
    
5.  **Download Files**  
    Grab files from the internet with `wget`:
    
    ```plaintext
    wget http://example.com/file.zip
    ```
    
6.  **Data Transfer**  
    Fetch a file using `curl`:
    
    ```plaintext
    curl -O http://example.com/file.zip
    ```
    
7.  **Get Help**  
    Not sure about a command? Check the manual with `man`:
    
    ```plaintext
    man ls
    ```
