Backups are essential to:

-   **Prevent Data Loss**: Recover from unexpected server crashes or hardware failures.
    
-   **Save Configuration Time**: Avoid manually recreating jobs, plugins, and settings.
    
-   **Ensure Business Continuity**: Quickly restore operations with minimal downtime.

1.  **Configuration Files**
    
    -   Jenkinsâ€™ core settings and user configurations are stored in the  `config.xml`  file.
2.  **Jobs and Pipelines**
    
    -   Each job or pipeline is stored as a directory under  `JENKINS_HOME/jobs`.
3.  **Plugins**
    
    -   Backup all plugin  `.jpi`  files under  `JENKINS_HOME/plugins`  to restore your environment easily.
4.  **Secrets and Credentials**
    
    -   Securely store credentials from the  `credentials.xml`  file.
5.  **User Data**
    
    -   User accounts and permissions are stored in  `users/`  under  `JENKINS_HOME`.

1.  Stop Jenkins to ensure files are not in use:

    ```
     sudo systemctl stop jenkins
    
    ```
    
2.  Copy the  `JENKINS_HOME`  directory to a secure location:

    ```
     cp -r /var/lib/jenkins /backup-location/
    
    ```
    
3.  Start Jenkins after the backup:
