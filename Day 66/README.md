AWS S3 is your storage solution for static files.

-   Log in to the  **AWS Management Console**  and navigate to S3.
    
-   Click on  **Create Bucket**  and give it a unique name like  `my-static-site-bucket`.
    
-   Once created, go to the  **Properties**  tab and enable  **Static Website Hosting**:
    
    -   Set your  **index document**  (e.g.,  `index.html`) and optionally, an error document (e.g.,  `404.html`).
        
    -   Save the configuration.

Now, itâ€™s time to add your static website files:

-   Drag and drop your  `index.html`, CSS, JS, and other files into the S3 bucket.
    
-   Keep public access disabled for now (weâ€™ll use CloudFront for secure access).

-   Locate the bucket URL in the  **Properties**  section.
    
-   Open the URL in your browser. If you see a  **403 Forbidden error**, donâ€™t worryâ€”it means the bucket is private as expected.

AWS CloudFront acts as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve your website globally.

-   Go to the  **CloudFront**  service in the AWS Console.
    
-   Click  **Create Distribution**  and choose:
    
    -   **Origin Domain Name**: Select your S3 bucket.
        
    -   **Enable Origin Access Identity (OAI)**: This allows CloudFront to access the bucket securely.
        
    -   Update the bucket policy to grant OAI permissions.

-   **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**  for secure connections.
    
-   Set the  **Default Root Object**  as  `index.html`.
    
-   Optionally, configure caching and regional restrictions for better performance.

-   Save your changes and deploy the distribution. It may take a few minutes to propagate.
    
-   Once deployed, youâ€™ll get a CloudFront domain name (e.g.,  [`example123.cloudfront.net`](http://example123.cloudfront.net/)).

-   Access your CloudFront domain name in a browser to check your website.
    
-   Ensure the S3 bucket is privateâ€”accessible only through CloudFront.
