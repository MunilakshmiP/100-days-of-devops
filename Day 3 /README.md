# Git Command Exercise

In today’s exercise, we will explore a series of essential Git commands that are crucial for version control and collaboration. This guide includes most of the commonly used commands in Git to give you a comprehensive understanding of how to work effectively with it. This hands-on practice will help you become more comfortable with version control as you navigate through common tasks. Let’s dive into the steps!

## Exercise Steps

### 1. Clone a Repository

Start by cloning an existing repository into a new directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/sample-repo.git
cd sample-repo

```

### 2. Initialize a New Git Repository

Create a new folder for your project and initialize a new Git repository.

```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
git init

```

### 3. Create and Add Files

Create a new file called  `example.txt`  and add some content to it.

```bash
echo "This is an example file." > example.txt
git add example.txt

```

### 4. Check Status

Check the status of your working directory and staging area.

```bash
git status

```

### 5. Commit Changes

Commit the changes you made to the  `example.txt`  file.

```bash
git commit -m "Add example.txt with initial content"

```

### 6. Rename a File

Rename  `example.txt`  to  `sample.txt`.

```bash
git mv example.txt sample.txt

```

### 7. Remove a File

Create another file called  `temp.txt`  and then remove it.

```bash
echo "Temporary file." > temp.txt
git add temp.txt
git commit -m "Add temp.txt"
git rm temp.txt
git commit -m "Remove temp.txt"

```

### 8. View Commit History

Show the commit logs to see your history.

```bash
git log

```

### 9. Create a Branch

Create a new branch called  `feature-branch`  and switch to it.

```bash
git branch feature-branch
git switch feature-branch

```

### 10. Make Changes and Commit on the New Branch

Modify the  `sample.txt`  file and commit the changes.

```bash
echo "Additional content for sample.txt." >> sample.txt
git add sample.txt
git commit -m "Add additional content to sample.txt"

```

### 11. Switch Back to the Main Branch

Switch back to the main branch.

```bash
git switch main

```

### 12. Merge Changes from the Feature Branch

Merge the changes from  `feature-branch`  into  `main`.

```bash
git merge feature-branch

```

### 13. Tag the Commit

Tag the current commit on the main branch.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"

```

### 14. Push Changes to Remote Repository

Push your changes to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin feature-branch
git push origin --tags

```

### 15. Fetch and Pull Changes from Remote

Simulate collaboration by fetching and pulling changes from the remote repository.

```bash
git fetch
git pull

```

### 16. Examine Differences

Check the differences between the working directory and the last commit.

```bash
git diff

```

### 17. View a Specific Commit

Show the details of a specific commit (use the commit hash from  `git log`).

```bash
git show <commit-hash>

```

By completing this exercise, you’ve gained hands-on experience with a wide range of Git commands that are essential for effective version control and collaboration. Keep practicing, and you’ll become more proficient over time!
