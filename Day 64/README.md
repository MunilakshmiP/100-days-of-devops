# Introduction to AWS ECR

Hello, everyone! Welcome to Day 64 of my 100 Days of DevOps journey. Today, I explored  **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, a fully managed Docker container registry service by AWS. If youâ€™re working with containers, understanding ECR is essential for storing, managing, and deploying your container images effectively.

In this blog, weâ€™ll cover:

1.  What AWS ECR is.
    
2.  Why itâ€™s important.
    
3.  How it compares to Docker Hub.
    
4.  A step-by-step guide to using AWS ECR.

AWS ECR is a service that lets you store, manage, and deploy container images securely and efficiently. Think of it as a cloud-based warehouse for your Docker images. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like ECS, EKS, and Lambda, making it ideal for containerized applications.

Here are some key reasons why AWS ECR stands out:

1.  **Ease of Integration**  
    AWS ECR works perfectly with AWS services like ECS (Elastic Container Service) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). This integration simplifies container deployments.
    
2.  **Secure Storage**  
    Images stored in ECR are encrypted, and IAM roles ensure only authorized users have access.
    
3.  **Automatic Image Scanning**  
    Detect vulnerabilities in container images before they are deployed.
    
4.  **High Availability**  
    ECR is reliable, ensuring your images are always accessible.
    
5.  **Pay-as-You-Go**  
    You only pay for the storage and transfer you use, making it cost-effective.

Hereâ€™s the StackEdit Markdown code for the table:

```markdown
| **Feature**          | **AWS ECR**                                         | **Docker Hub**                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Integration**       | Integrates seamlessly with AWS services like ECS, EKS. | Works across multiple platforms, not tied to any cloud. |
| **Security**          | Fine-grained IAM control, automatic encryption.     | Basic access control with public/private repositories. |
| **Image Scanning**    | Automatic scanning for vulnerabilities.             | Manual scanning (pro feature).                     |
| **Cost**              | Pay-as-you-go for storage and transfer.             | Free tier with limited pulls; paid plans for more. |
| **Public Repositories** | Focused on private repositories (no public option). | Popular for sharing public images widely.          |
| **Speed**             | Faster for AWS regions, optimized for internal use. | General-purpose, depends on geographic proximity.  |
| **Access Management** | Detailed IAM policies for team control.             | Simpler team management, less customizable.        |

```

**Which to Choose?**

-   **AWS ECR**: Ideal if youâ€™re deeply embedded in the AWS ecosystem and need private, secure, and efficient storage for container images.
    
-   **Docker Hub**: Great for sharing public images or if youâ€™re working in a multi-cloud environment.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-64-of-100-days-introduction-to-aws-ecr#heading-1-create-a-repository "Permalink")**1. Create a Repository**

1.  Log in to your AWS Management Console.
    
2.  Search for "ECR" in the services tab.
    
3.  Click "Create Repository" and give it a name, e.g.,  `my-app-repo`.
    

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-64-of-100-days-introduction-to-aws-ecr#heading-2-authenticate-docker-to-ecr "Permalink")**2. Authenticate Docker to ECR**

Run the following command in your terminal to authenticate Docker to ECR:

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

```

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-64-of-100-days-introduction-to-aws-ecr#heading-3-tag-your-docker-image "Permalink")**3. Tag Your Docker Image**

Tag your local Docker image so it can be pushed to the ECR repository:

```
docker tag my-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-app-repo:latest

```

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-64-of-100-days-introduction-to-aws-ecr#heading-4-push-the-image "Permalink")**4. Push the Image**

Finally, push the tagged image to your ECR repository:

```
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-app-repo:latest

```

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-64-of-100-days-introduction-to-aws-ecr#heading-5-pull-the-image "Permalink")**5. Pull the Image**

To pull the image, use this command:

```
docker pull <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-app-repo:latest

```

AWS ECR is an excellent choice for storing and managing Docker container images, especially if youâ€™re already working in the AWS ecosystem. Its seamless integration, robust security features, and pay-as-you-go model make it a powerful tool for containerized applications. While Docker Hub remains a popular option for public repositories and multi-cloud use cases, ECR is the go-to solution for private, enterprise-level container image storage in AWS.

I hope this blog helped you understand AWS ECR better. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback! ðŸ˜Š
