Imagine building a secure CI/CD pipeline. Your Docker registry credentials, database usernames, passwords, or API keys are the heart of your infrastructure. If these secrets are compromised, your systemâ€™s security is at stake.

AWS provides excellent tools for securely managing secrets across services like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and more. Letâ€™s explore how to leverage them effectively!

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-1-aws-systems-manager-parameter-store "Permalink")1.  **AWS Systems Manager (Parameter Store)**

**Best for**: Storing non-critical credentials or string-based parameters.  
AWS Systems Managerâ€™s  **Parameter Store**  is a great starting point. Itâ€™s super simple to use, but rememberâ€”this service is less secure than others, so itâ€™s ideal for storing non-sensitive data.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-how-it-works "Permalink")How It Works:

-   **Storage**: Stores parameters as plain text, SecureString, or string lists.
    
-   **IAM Integration**: Use IAM roles to control access to these parameters.

1.  Navigate to the  **Parameter Store**  in AWS Systems Manager.
    
2.  Create a new parameter, name it  `docker-username`, and set its type to  **SecureString**.
    
3.  Retrieve the value in your code:

    ```
     aws ssm get-parameter --name "docker-username" --with-decryption --region us-east-1
    
    ```
    
4.  Grant appropriate IAM permissions to the service accessing this parameter.

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-2-aws-secrets-manager "Permalink")2.  **AWS Secrets Manager**

**Best for**: Storing highly sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and certificates.

AWS Secrets Manager takes security up a notch! It can automatically  **rotate secrets**  like passwords every 90 days, ensuring your credentials stay fresh and safe.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-key-features "Permalink")Key Features:

-   Automated  **secret rotation**  (e.g., passwords).
    
-   Track validity dates for certificates.
    
-   Easily integrate with other AWS services like RDS or Lambda.
    

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-example-rotating-a-database-password-automatically "Permalink")Example: Rotating a Database Password Automatically

Letâ€™s say your app connects to an RDS database. Hereâ€™s how you can automate secret rotation:

1.  Store the database password in Secrets Manager.
    
2.  Enable  **automatic rotation**  and specify the Lambda function to update the database password.
    
3.  Retrieve the secret securely in your app:

    ```
     aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id MyDatabaseSecret --region us-east-1
    
    ```

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-3-hashicorp-vault "Permalink")3.  **HashiCorp Vault**

**Best for**: Multi-cloud environments or hybrid architectures.

If your company uses AWS, Azure, or other cloud providers, managing secrets across platforms can be daunting. Enter  **HashiCorp Vault**â€”a centralized, open-source solution for secure secret management.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-why-is-it-popular "Permalink")Why Is It Popular?

-   Supports  **encryption**  for added security.
    
-   Seamlessly transitions credentials between platforms during migrations.
    

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-example-storing-an-api-key "Permalink")Example: Storing an API Key

1.  Install HashiCorp Vault.
    
2.  Store an API key:

    ```
     vault kv put secret/api-key key=1234abcd
    
    ```
    
3.  Retrieve the API key:

    ```
     vault kv get secret/api-key
    
    ```

## When to Use Each Service?
| **Use Case**               | **Service**            | **Reason**                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Store non-sensitive data    | AWS Systems Manager   | Easy to use, integrates well with AWS          |
| Store sensitive credentials | AWS Secrets Manager   | Automated rotation and high security           |
| Multi-cloud or hybrid setup | HashiCorp Vault       | Centralized, works across different clouds     |

## [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-real-life-scenario "Permalink")Real-Life Scenario

Imagine a CI/CD pipeline where:

1.  The  **username**  for a Docker registry is stored in  **Parameter Store**.
    
2.  The  **password**  is stored in  **Secrets Manager**.
    
3.  Your organization uses both AWS and Azure, so  **HashiCorp Vault**  is used for API keys to ensure portability.
    

This approach balances simplicity and security, leveraging the best features of each service.

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-63-of-100-days-secret-management-on-aws-simplified-and-secure#heading-goal-securely-manage-docker-credentials "Permalink")Goal: Securely manage Docker credentials

1.  Store the  **username**  in Parameter Store.
    
2.  Store the  **password**  in Secrets Manager.
    
3.  Use HashiCorp Vault for storing API keys if transitioning across clouds.
    

Test your setup by granting limited IAM permissions and verifying access through your CI/CD pipeline.
