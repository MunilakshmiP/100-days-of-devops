1.  **Authentication**
    
    -   Verifies user identity.
        
    -   Can be integrated with tools like:
        
        -   LDAP
            
        -   Single Sign-On (SSO) systems
            
        -   External providers like Google, GitHub, etc.
            
2.  **Authorization**
    
    -   Controls user permissions.
        
    -   Types:
        
        -   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns specific roles to users or groups.
            
        -   **Matrix Authorization**: Offers granular control over jobs, nodes, and configurations.

-   **Purpose**: Protect sensitive data like tokens, SSH keys, or passwords.
    
-   Use the  **Credentials Plugin**  to store, encrypt, and manage credentials securely.

As organizations grow, Jenkins must scale efficiently to support larger workloads.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-master-slave-architecture "Permalink")**Master-Slave Architecture**

-   **Concept**: Distributes builds across multiple agents (slaves) managed by a central master.
    
-   **Benefits**:
    
    -   Increases speed by running parallel jobs.
        
    -   Balances workloads across diverse environments (e.g., Linux vs. Windows agents).
        

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-performance-optimization "Permalink")**Performance Optimization**

1.  **Distributed Builds**
    
    -   Use agents to process multiple builds simultaneously.
2.  **Caching Mechanisms**
    
    -   Utilize tools like Docker caching to speed up container-based builds.
3.  **Resource Allocation**
    
    -   Assign CPU and memory limits to prevent node overloading.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-cicd-concepts "Permalink")**CI/CD Concepts**

-   Continuous Integration (CI): Automates code merging, testing, and quality checks.
    
-   Continuous Deployment (CD): Automates the release of stable, tested builds to production.
    

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-gitops "Permalink")**GitOps**

-   **Definition**: Git serves as the source of truth for infrastructure and application code.
    
-   **Jenkinsâ€™ Role**:
    
    -   Automates workflows triggered by Git changes.
        
    -   Ensures that deployments are auditable and version-controlled.

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-backups-and-recovery "Permalink")**Backups and Recovery**

-   **Importance**: Safeguard against data loss and ensure system continuity.
    
-   **Approaches**:
    
    -   Back up Jenkins configurations, jobs, and credentials regularly.
        
    -   Use the  **ThinBackup Plugin**  for automated backups.
        

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-25-of-100-days-mastering-jenkins-security-scalability-and-advanced-topics#heading-monitoring-and-troubleshooting "Permalink")**Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

-   **Logs**: Analyze build and system logs to identify errors.
    
-   **Real-Time Monitoring**:
    
    -   Integrate Jenkins with  **Prometheus**  or  **ELK Stack**.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Keep an eye on build durations, queue times, and node usage.
