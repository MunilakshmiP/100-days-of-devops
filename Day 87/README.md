#  YAML Basics and Creating Ansible Playbooks
Welcome to Day 87 of my  **100 Days of DevOps**  journey! Today, we're diving into YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) and exploring how to use it to create Ansible playbooks for infrastructure automation. Let's break it down step-by-step.

----------

## [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-what-is-yaml "Permalink")**What is YAML?**

YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language" and is commonly used in configuration files due to its simplicity and readability. It follows a human-readable data format and is heavily used in DevOps tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose.

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-key-features-of-yaml "Permalink")**Key Features of YAML:**

-   **Readable**: Uses indentation for structure.
    
-   **Data Types**: Supports scalars, lists, and dictionaries.
    
-   **Key-Value Pairs**: Defines configuration with ease.
    

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-basic-yaml-syntax "Permalink")**Basic YAML Syntax:**

1.  **Key-Value Pairs**:


```
key: value

```

2.  **Lists**:

```
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - cherry

```

3.  **Dictionaries**:


```
person:
  name: John
  age: 30

```

4.  **Comments**:

```
# This is a comment
key: value

```

> **Pro Tip:**  Indentation in YAML uses spaces, not tabs. Consistency is crucial to avoid parsing errors.

## [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-ansible-and-yaml "Permalink")**Ansible and YAML**

Ansible uses YAML to define playbooks, which are scripts that describe how Ansible should automate tasks.

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-structure-of-an-ansible-playbook "Permalink")**Structure of an Ansible Playbook:**

-   **Hosts**: The group of machines where tasks will run.
    
-   **Tasks**: The actions to perform on the hosts.
    
-   **Modules**: The tools to execute specific tasks (e.g.,  `shell`,  `copy`,  `apt`).

Copy

Copy

```
---
- name: Install and start Apache web server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started

```

**Explanation:**

-   `---`: Indicates the start of a YAML document.
    
-   `name`: Provides a description of the play or task.
    
-   `hosts`: Specifies the target machines.
    
-   `become: yes`: Elevates privileges to perform tasks as root.

### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-87-of-100-days-yaml-basics-and-creating-ansible-playbooks#heading-step-1-prerequisites "Permalink")**Step 1: Prerequisites**

-   Ansible installed on your control node.
    
-   SSH access to the target servers.
    
-   An inventory file specifying your servers.

1.  **Modify the Playbook:**
    
    -   Add tasks to install additional packages like  `curl`  or  `git`.
        
    -   Include a step to create a backup of the existing  `index.html`  file.
        
2.  **Use Variables in Playbooks:**  Create a playbook that uses variables for package names and file paths:
    
    Copy
    
    Copy
    
    ```
     ---
     - name: Deploy Web Server with Variables
       hosts: webservers
       vars:
         web_package: apache2
         html_path: /var/www/html/index.html
       tasks:
         - name: Install Web Server
           apt:
             name: "{{ web_package }}"
             state: present
    
         - name: Ensure Web Server is Running
           service:
             name: "{{ web_package }}"
             state: started
    
    ```
    
3.  **Challenge Yourself:**
    
    -   Write a playbook to install and configure MySQL.
        
    -   Automate the deployment of a static website hosted on multiple servers.
