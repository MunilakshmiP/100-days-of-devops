## Mastering Terraform Workspaces for Multi-Environment Management
Managing infrastructure across multiple environments like development, staging, and production is a core responsibility of a DevOps engineer. On Day 82 of my 100 Days of DevOps journey, I explored  **Terraform Workspaces**, a powerful feature to efficiently manage multi-environment infrastructure.

When working with Terraform, creating infrastructure for multiple environments without impacting existing resources can be tricky. For example, if you manage EC2 instances for development, staging, and production environments:

-   Updating an instance in one environment should not affect others.
    
-   Separate configurations and state files are essential to maintain isolation.
    

Let’s dive into a practical scenario to address this challenge..

1.  Create a directory for your Terraform project:
    

    
    ```
     mkdir terraform-workspace-demo && cd terraform-workspace-demo
    
    ```
    
2.  Write the main configuration in  [`main.tf`](http://main.tf/):
    
    Copy
    
    ```
     provider "aws" {
       region = "us-east-1"
     }
    
     resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
       bucket = "${terraform.workspace}-unique-demo-bucket"
       acl    = "private"
     }
    
     output "bucket_name" {
       value = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
     }
    
    ```
    
    -   **Key points**:
        
        -   `terraform.workspace`  dynamically retrieves the active workspace name.
            
        -   The bucket name is unique for each environment based on the workspace.

Run the following command to initialize the project:



```
terraform init

```

Terraform Workspaces manage isolated state files for different environments. Let’s create and switch between environments.

1.  **Create the**  `dev`  workspace:
    

    
    ```
     terraform workspace new dev
    
    ```
    
    This creates a new state file for the  `dev`  environment.
    
2.  **Create the**  `stage`  workspace:
    

    
    ```
     terraform workspace new stage
    
    ```
    
3.  **Switch between workspaces**:

    
    ```
     terraform workspace select dev
    
    ```
    
4.  **Verify the current workspace**:

    
    ```
     terraform workspace show
    
    ```
    
    The output will display:
    

    
    ```
     dev
    
    ```

Now, let’s create an S3 bucket for the  `dev`  and  `stage`  environments.

1.  **Apply the configuration for**  `dev`:
    

    
    ```
     terraform apply
    
    ```
    
    -   Terraform will create an S3 bucket named  `dev-unique-demo-bucket`.
        
    -   The state file will be stored in  `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.d/dev/`.
        

Output:



```
    Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    Outputs:
    bucket_name = "dev-unique-demo-bucket"

```

2.  **Switch to**  `stage`  and apply:
    

    
    ```
     terraform workspace select stage
     terraform apply
    
    ```
    
    -   Terraform will create an S3 bucket named  `stage-unique-demo-bucket`.
        
    -   The state file will be stored in  `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.d/stage/`.
        

Output:



```
    Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    Outputs:
    bucket_name = "stage-unique-demo-bucket"

```

Each workspace maintains its state file under  `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace-name>`. For example:

-   `dev`  state file:  `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate`
    
-   `stage`  state file:  `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.d/stage/terraform.tfstate`
    

This ensures complete isolation of environments.
