A rolling deployment gradually replaces old application versions with new ones across instances, ensuring zero downtime. Canary deployment releases changes to a small subset of users first to gather feedback before a full rollout.

----------

An ephemeral environment is a short-lived, on-demand environment created for specific purposes like testing or development. It is beneficial for cost savings, isolation, and maintaining clean production environments.

----------

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-92-of-100-days-mastering-more-devops-interview-questions#heading-12-how-do-you-monitor-microservices-effectively "Permalink")12.  **How do you monitor microservices effectively?**

Monitoring microservices involves collecting metrics, logs, and traces. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger provide insights into service health, dependencies, and latency. Centralized logging with ELK Stack ensures efficient troubleshooting.

----------

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-92-of-100-days-mastering-more-devops-interview-questions#heading-13-explain-the-importance-of-container-networking "Permalink")13.  **Explain the importance of container networking.**

Container networking enables communication between containers and external systems. Kubernetes manages container networking using network plugins like Calico or Cilium, ensuring secure and scalable communication.

Dynamic scaling automatically adjusts the number of application instances based on demand. Tools like Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler monitor resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory) and add or remove instances as needed.

----------

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-92-of-100-days-mastering-more-devops-interview-questions#heading-15-what-is-the-difference-between-a-bind-mount-and-a-volume-in-docker "Permalink")15.  **What is the difference between a bind mount and a volume in Docker?**

Bind mounts link a host directory to a container, providing flexibility but less security. Volumes are managed by Docker, offering better performance and isolation, making them ideal for persistent data storage in production environments.

----------

#### [](https://100daysdevops.hashnode.dev/day-92-of-100-days-mastering-more-devops-interview-questions#heading-16-how-do-you-implement-access-control-in-devops-workflows "Permalink")16.  **How do you implement access control in DevOps workflows?**

Access control is implemented using role-based access control (RBAC) policies in tools like Kubernetes or AWS IAM. These policies restrict user permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
