## What is DevOps?

[](https://github.com/MunilakshmiP/100-days-of-devops/tree/main/Day-1#what-is-devops)

DevOps bridges the gap between  **development (Dev)**  and  **operations (Ops)**  teams, enabling effective collaboration. This teamwork, combined with automation, helps deliver software faster and with fewer issues.

**Scenario:**  Imagine a team developing a mobile app. In a non-DevOps setup, developers finish coding and pass it to operations, who may face deployment issues because they werenâ€™t involved earlier. With DevOps, both teams work together from the start. Automated testing catches bugs quickly, and deployment tools release updates seamlessly without delays.

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps incorporates security as a shared responsibility within DevOps, ensuring that security checks are integrated throughout the software development process.

**Scenario:**  Think of a banking app. With DevSecOps, security testing is embedded early, allowing potential risks to be identified before deployment. This proactive approach safeguards against data breaches and vulnerabilities.

## History of DevOps

DevOps emerged from the need for better collaboration between development and operations teams. Traditional methods often separated these areas, leading to misunderstandings and delays during application deployments.

**Scenario:**  In the early web service days, if a new feature failed, the dev team would blame the ops team and vice versa. DevOps was introduced to eliminate this blame game, fostering synchronization and improving software delivery times.

-   **Faster Delivery:**  Regular and automated deployments facilitate frequent updates.
    
    -   _Example:_  A social media app rolls out new features weekly without disrupting user experience.
-   **Improved Collaboration:**  Teams work together with shared goals and responsibilities.
    
    -   _Example:_  A developer and an ops engineer resolve issues quickly through shared tools.
-   **Better Quality:**  Automated testing catches bugs early.
    
    -   _Example:_  An e-commerce site tests all code updates automatically to maintain stability.
-   **Reduced Complexity:**  Automating routine tasks minimizes human error.
    
    -   _Example:_  DevOps automates server updates for an online gaming platform, preventing gameplay issues.
-   **Quick Problem Resolution:**  Real-time monitoring enables faster issue detection.
    
    -   _Example:_  A video streaming service quickly addresses buffering issues to enhance user experience.

1.  **Collaboration:**  Close teamwork improves performance.
    
    -   _Example:_  Developers and ops share a dashboard to track site performance.
2.  **Automation:**  Routine tasks are automated to minimize errors.
    
    -   _Example:_  A music app automates updates, ensuring timely delivery.
3.  **Continuous Improvement:**  Enhancing processes and workflows constantly.
    
    -   _Example:_  An online shopping platform regularly refines load times based on feedback.
4.  **Customer-Centric Action:**  User needs are prioritized in decision-making.
    
    -   _Example:_  A food delivery app updates features based on customer feedback.
5.  **End-Goal Focus:**  Aligning every task with the broader objective.
    
    -   _Example:_  A project management tool prioritizes features that boost productivity.
